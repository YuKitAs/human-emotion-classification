# Deep Learning Final Project - Human Emotion Classification

This project was developed to classify 6 human emotions from photos using deep learning techniques, for educational purposes.

The models were trained on the [public dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yousefmohamed20/sentiment-images-classifier/data).

To run the notebook, first download the image directories from the public dataset into the `data/original/` folder in the project root, then install the required dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Any suggestions and feedback are welcome.
